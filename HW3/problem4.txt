1. 	The script sets the xlabel and ylabel for the plot to be "Rank" and "Size (bytes)
	respectively. It then declares that the range of x values will be from 0 to 100.
	It then says that the output of the script will be named 'scatterplot.eps'.
	The script ends by plotting the data in results.txt, using columns 1 and 3 in the file 
	(the 1:3 notation) as x and y respectively, with a blank title ( the ""), and the data 
	are represented by points instead of some other symbol or as a connected line.
	
2.	Looking at the scatterplot, there seems to be no correlation between the size of the index
	file and the site's popularity. The vast majority of sites are under 100000 bytes, including 
	the #1 site and the #100 site. However, we also see one of the top 10 websites with a size of 
	nearly 600000 bytes, while there are many lower ranked sites with sub-100000 sizes.
