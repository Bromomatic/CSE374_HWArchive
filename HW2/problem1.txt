# Shawn Stern, CSE 374 Homework 2, Problem 1

1. echo

I enter the following command into the shell:
echo -n blotz 2>err.txt

The echo command prints just 'blotz' to the shell. The '2>err.txt' redirects any
output to stderr to a textfile, so that there is no output to stderr itself.

Output:
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ echo blotz 2>err.txt
blotz
[swstern@klaatu ~]$


2. cat

This is accomplished with the following line:
echo -n blotz | cat 2>err.txt

The output of 'echo blotz' (from part 1 above) is piped into cat, which makes it appear in the shell.
Once again, 2>err.txt redirects any possible writes to stderr to a textfile instead.

Output:
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ echo blotz | cat 2>err.txt
blotz
[swstern@klaatu ~]$


3. ls

This is accomplished with the following lines:
echo > blotz
ls blotz 2> err.txt

To use ls, I first create a blank file with the name blotz. I then use 'ls blotz' to only list
the file named blotz. Again, the 2>err.txt argument is added to redirect errors from stderr to 
a text file. 

Output:
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ echo > blotz
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ ls blotz 2>err.txt
blotz
[swstern@klaatu ~]$


4. grep

This is accomplished with the following lines:
echo blotz > blotz.txt
grep blotz blotz.txt 2>err.txt

In this case, I create a file containing the text 'blotz', then grep for 
that string in the file. This sends the matching line to stdout, printing just 'blotz'.

Output:
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ echo blotz > blotz.txt
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ grep blotz blotz.txt 2>err.txt
blotz
[swstern@klaatu ~]$


5. !!

For this, we find a command that does nothing at all. In this case, the command 'false' fits the bill.
Using an alias, we can set the shell such that typing blotz will run false instead. This means that when 
the !! command is sent, blotz will be printed, followed by nothing at all, which means only blotz
ends up printed! Again, we make sure to add a redirect so that no errors are printed to the shell,
and instead go to a file.

Output:
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ alias blotz='false 2>err.txt'
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ blotz
[swstern@klaatu ~]$ !!
blotz
[swstern@klaatu ~]$
